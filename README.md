## What's Included?

Hyperswitch is architected as a comprehensive suite comprising multiple
components, each housed in separate repositories and open-sourced.

- At its core lies the [Hyperswitch app server][hyperswitch], serving as the
  central hub orchestrating various functionalities.
- The suite extends further with the [Hyperswitch web client][hyperswitch-web],
  responsible for collecting payment information from end-users.
- Additionally, the Hyperswitch web client offers seamless integration options,
  including a dedicated wrapper for WooCommerce merchants known as the
  [Hyperswitch WooCommerce plugin][hyperswitch-woocommerce-plugin].
- [Hyperswitch Vault][hyperswitch-card-vault] is the component that is
  responsible for storing card and other payment method details securely in a
  PCI compliant manner away from the main app server.
- For merchants, the [Hyperswitch Control Center][hyperswitch-control-center]
  serves as a centralized dashboard, granting access to payment data and
  analytics.
- Throughout this ecosystem, interaction predominantly occurs with the
  Hyperswitch app server, facilitating the seamless exchange of payment-related
  information.

## Join us in building Hyperswitch

### Our Belief

> Payments should be open, fast, reliable and affordable to serve
> the billions of people at scale.

Globally payment diversity has been growing at a rapid pace.
There are hundreds of payment processors and new payment methods like BNPL,
RTP etc.
Businesses need to embrace this diversity to increase conversion, reduce cost
and improve control.
But integrating and maintaining multiple processors needs a lot of dev effort.
Why should devs across companies repeat the same work?
Why can't it be unified and reused? Hence, Hyperswitch was born to create that
reusable core and let companies build and customize it as per their specific
requirements.

### Our Values

1. Embrace Payments Diversity: It will drive innovation in the ecosystem in
   multiple ways.
2. Make it Open Source: Increases trust; Improves the quality and reusability of
   software.
3. Be community driven: It enables participatory design and development.
4. Build it like Systems Software: This sets a high bar for Reliability,
   Security and Performance SLAs.
5. Maximize Value Creation: For developers, customers & partners.
